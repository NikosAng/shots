              How Have Shots Changed
            </div>

                Over the past decade, football has experienced significant transformations. 
                The introduction of analytics, the evolution of tactics and the of player's roles, and a shifting emphasis on possession and complex tactical structures 
                have all reshaped the game. 
                Amidst these changes, we ask ourselves how the nature of one the most fundamental elements of the game has changed: shots on goal.
                For our analysis we'll use data on shots taken from the four largest football leagues in Europe: La Liga, Bundesliga, Premier League, and Serie A, spanning seven seasons from 2014/15 to 2020/21.

                
            </p>
        </div>


        <p>
            Initially, we look at the circumstances leading up to shots. 
            The barplots show the situations from which shots to goal arise. 
            What's  striking is that there is an impressive consistency both across seasons and leagues. 
            Approximately 70% of shots originate from open play, followed by corners (15%), set pieces (5%), direct free kicks (3%), and penalties.
        </p>



        <div id="title" style="text-align:center; font-size:20px; font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:10px;">Situations from Which Shots on Goal Arise</div>

        <div id="situations">
            <div id="bundesliga"></div>
            <div id="la_liga"></div>
            <div id="serie_a"></div>
            <div id="premier_league"></div>
            <div id="legend"></div>
        </div>


        <p>
            Delving deeper into open play shots, we investigate their origin - are they a product of passing or the result of individual skills and rebounds? 
            Generally, the percentage of Open Play shots arising from passes shows minor fluctuations, floating between 50 and 60%. 
            Serie A and Premier league are relatively stable in this respect. 
            There is a sharp upward trend in Bundesliga with the percentage rising from 52% in 2014/15 to 58% in 2020/21.
            And similarly there is a noticeable upward trend in La Liga with the percentage rising from 54% to 57%.

        </p>

        <div id="passes"></div>


        <p>
            Having established shot contexts, we now shift our attention to the accuracy of shots taken. 
            As an initial rough proxy to gauge this, we examine the median expected goals (xGoals) across the leagues over the seven seasons. 
            In all leagues there is a notable upward trend, teams are clearly generating better chances of scoring goals. 
        </p>

   
        

            <div id="xg-plot"></div>


            <p>
                The xGoals graph doesn't give the whole picture however. 
                The boost in xGoals might be due to either an enhancement in shot precision or an increase in shot attempts. 
                To disentangle this, we delve into the shot conversion rate, the ratio of shots resulting in goals. 
                Except for Serie A, where there's a considerable rise, signifying a more prolific and accurate shooting rate, the conversion rate remains relatively stable.
            </p>
          
          <div id="conversion"></div>





             <p>
                The last segment of our analysis focuses on the location from which shots are taken. 
                We represent this visually using heatmaps over football pitches that show 
                the percentage change in shot volume based on pitch location between seasons 2014/15 and 2020/21. 
                In general, the heatmaps hint at a strategic shift towards more shots within the penalty area, accompanied by a decrease in shots from further out.
                Starting with the Premier League it's clear that there's been a significant reduction in shots made outside the box, 
                indicated by the prevalent red color. Inside the box, the color shifts to blue, albeit with sporadic red patches.
                
            </p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="./assets/pl.png">
              </div>

            <p>
                Moving on to Serie A we see the same pattern as above. An overall decline of shots taken as the distance from the goal increases. 
                The closer we get to the box the bluer the color gets. 
            </p>
              
              <div class="image-container">
                <img src="./assets/seriea.png">
              </div>
              <p>
                Things are not as clear in La Liga though. 
            </p>             

              <div class="image-container">
                <img src="./assets/laliga.png">
              </div>
              <p>
                Finally, in Bundesliga, there are more shots taken from inside the box than from outside in 2020/21 as compared to 2014/15. 
            </p>       
              <div class="image-container">
                <img src="./assets/bundesliga.png">
              </div>
              
              

        <p>
            This pattern appears to corroborate the rise in xGoals, suggesting that players 
            are opting for higher quality shots from within the penalty area over long-range attempts. 
            We further complement this analysis with an interactive 2D density plot, offering  a visualization of shot density in each season across different leagues.

        <h2>Sources and Methodology</h2>
        <p>The analysis presented is based on shot data gathered from Understat, available at Edd Webster's <a href="https://github.com/eddwebster/football_analytics/tree/master/data/understat/shots">GitHub repository</a>. 
           
        The initial raw data was processed and cleaned using R.
        Following data cleaning, we conducted an exploratory data analysis in R to understand the patterns and trends in the data. 
        This involved binning the data based on shot location, grouping, and calculating shot count differences.
        Data visualization was performed using a combination of R and D3, a JavaScript library for producing dynamic and interactive data visualizations.
    </p>

    <p>The title image was generated in Midjourney.</p>

    <p>The visualizations of shot locations were inspired by Mark Carey's<a href="https://github.com/eddwebster/football_analytics/tree/master/data/understat/shots"> piece for the Athletic</a>
        and John Muller's <a href="https://github.com/eddwebster/football_analytics/tree/master/data/understat/shots">piece for FiveThirtyEight</a>.
